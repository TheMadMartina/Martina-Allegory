## About

This isn’t a tale or a metaphor. There is literally someone behind **Martina**.  
A real person exists behind all of this, and this GitHub account is my second one.  
It isn’t a character or a fictional identity—it’s simply me, continuing forward under a different name.

This wasn’t a decision I made lightly, nor was there a real option to avoid it.  
A simple turn of events caused me to lose my previous account, and that moment changed everything.  
What came after wasn’t planned, but it was inevitable.

Losing that account is what shaped this identity.  
That is how I became **Martina**.
